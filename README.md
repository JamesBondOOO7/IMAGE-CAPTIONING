# IMAGE-CAPTIONING

This is one of the very interesting applications of Deep Learning
<br>
What it does is, it takes an image as an input and tries to predict an appropriate caption for that image !!



# Steps

1. Data Collection
2. Understanding the data
3. Data Cleaning
4. Loading the training set
5. Data Preprocessing of Images
6. Data Preprocessing of Captions
7. Data Preparation using Generator Function
8. Word Embeddings
9. Model Architecture
10. Inference
11. Evaluation

# Dataset
Flikr8k dataset

- 6000 images for training
- 1000 for validation
- 1000 for testing

- 5 captions to describe an image
